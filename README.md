### You're probably looking for [rustup.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs) if you arrived from Google
Despite being in rust-lang-nursery org, [rustup.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs)  is now the default rustup. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang/rustup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang/rustup)

The `rustup.sh` script installs Rust from the Rust release channels. It is most often run as a copy of the file alone.

**Note**: `rustup.sh` will be replaced by [`rustup.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs).

```
curl -sf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh
```

Features:

* Install from stable, beta, or nightly channels.
* Install from the archives.
* Verifies hashes.
* Verifies signatures (if gpg is available).
* Resumes downloads.
* For Linux and OS X (Windows support someday).

## Examples

Download and install the default channel, currently beta.

```
rustup.sh
```

Install to a particular location.

```
rustup.sh --prefix=my/install/dir
```

Save downloads for faster re-installs.

```
rustup.sh --save
```

Install nightly.

```
rustup.sh --channel=nightly
```

Install nightly archives.

```
rustup.sh --channel=nightly --date=2015-04-09
```

Install explicit versions.

```
rustup.sh --revision=1.0.0-beta
```

## Future work

* GC old temp and cache files.
* Error on unknown command line options.
* Do cleanup of in-use temp files on trap.
* Don't clobber multirust if it is installed at the destination prefix.
